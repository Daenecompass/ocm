<p><em>This utility is in beta.</em></p>
<h2>Mac OS X Download Script</h2>
<p>This screen will generate a script to download your Pika CMS data, in CSV format,
to a local computer running Mac OS X.  It can also generate a LaunchAgent that
will run the script automatically at 2:30 AM if the user account is left logged
in.</p>
<p>The script will only work for servers that running on a secure, HTTPS-enabled server.
	If, for some reason, your Pika CMS server only accepts unencrypted connections,
	the script won't run correctly.
</p>
<h4>Instructions for Setting Up Nightly Downloads</h3>
<p>Please take the proper precautions to secure both the .php script that you
	download from this page and also the .csv data files that the script downloads.
	Both contain sensitive data.
<ul>
	<li>First, you'll need to fill out the form below.  The UNIX path is required, the password field is 
	optional.  IMPORTANT:  If you enter a password, it'll be saved, in plain 
	text, to the .php script file you download.  If you leave the password
	field blank, you'll need to manually add it using a text editor after 
	downloading it.  In either case, your Pika CMS
	password will be stored in plain text on your computer.   
	<li>Press the two buttons to download
	the two files to your computer.  
	<li>Then open a Finder window.  
	<li>On the "Go"
	menu, select "Home".  
	<li>Create a folder named "cms" (all lower-case).  Move 
	the .php script file you downloaded to the new "cms" folder.  
	<li>Next, select "Home"
	from the "Go" menu again.  
	<li>On the "Go" menu, select "Go to Folder" and type
	"Library" (case-sensitive).  
	<li>Go to the "LaunchAgents" folder.  Move the .plist
	 LaunchAgent file you downloaded to this folder.  
	 <li>Log out, then log back in.
	 The database will now be downloaded to the "cms" folder nightly at 2:30 AM 
	 local time, as long as computer is left logged in.
</ul>
