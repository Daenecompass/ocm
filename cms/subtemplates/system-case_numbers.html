<h2>Case Numbering</h2>
Pika cases are auto numbered at creation using an incrementing counter maintained by the system.
Organizations occasionally need to restart the numbering sequence (usually at the beginning of a new year)
in order to organize cases more efficiently.  The form below will allow you to 
change the case number counter to fit your needs.<br/>
<br/>
The next opened case number will be: <b>%%[new_number]%%</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Example: %%[new_number_ex]%%)<br/>
The total number of cases opened this year is: <b>%%[cases_ytd]%%</b><br/>
<br/>
<form action="%%[base_url]%%/system-case_numbers.php" method="POST">
	<input type="text" name="case_number" value="%%[case_number]%%" tabindex="1" />
	<input type="hidden" name="action" value="update" />
	<input type="submit" name="submit" value="Update Counter" tabindex="1" />
</form>
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> The counter will always be one less than the next case number that is generated.
